I'm learning to code. Earlier this summer, I decided to apply for acceptance into a full stack web development course offered by Flatiron School. I was accepted and here I now am.

Thinking back, I can't recall the exact motivation I had to apply. I hadn't thought through how I would source funds for the monthly tuition or what my plan would be after course completion. I knew I wanted to keep learning, not simply because it was "something to add to my resume," but more so because I never want to feel as if I'm trapped in a box. I don't want to be a "digital marketer" or even just a "content strategist" although both of those descriptors can be endlessly long definitions.

Moreover, I recently renewed the subscription to my "personal" site, and I realized I wanted to be known as a creator and I hadn't created anything for a long time. I was managing other people's projects, running internship programs, reading in my spare time and seemingly walking through the world on autopilot like some kind of android. I've had Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep spinning in my mind for the entire summer, since I had finished reading it early on in the season.

So I'm learning a new language, a different way of expressing commands and definitions, one of the most recently invented languages in our human history. There's this instant satisfaction in the learning process, the concept that you can learn a line of code, save it inside a document and execute the "program" with the click of a few buttons.
